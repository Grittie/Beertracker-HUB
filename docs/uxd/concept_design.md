## Concept

The **Smart Check in / out system** is being developed for [beertracker.nl](http://beertracker.nl) <img src="../../assets/images/logo.png" alt="Alt text" width="100" />, a platform used by HvA students. The system helps track beer ordering so that everyone pays equally without needing to request payments after the fact.

<br>


### Main Goal
As a HvA student using beertracker.nl, my primary goal is to ensure that the consumption and ordering of beer is tracked accurately, so I can pay my fair share without having to manually calculate or request payments from others. I want a simple and efficient way to clock in when I start drinking and clock out when I'm done, knowing that the system will automatically track how much I've ordered and what I owe, ensuring fair and equal payments among all participants.

### Product Requirements

The clock in and clock out system for beertracker.nl will meet the following SMART requirements:

**Specific**:

- The system must enable users (HvA students) to clock in when they start drinking and clock out when they finish.
- It must track each user's drinking session, log the start and end times, and calculate the total beer ordering for each user.

**Measurable**:

- The system must record at least 95% of drinking sessions without error and provide clear consumption and payment data for each user.
- It will display the total number of users who have clocked in, total consumption per session, and individual ordering per user.
- Will update the main dashboard.
- Have a history with each session.

**Achievable**:

- The system will use RFID tags to allow users to clock in and out quickly, minimizing manual input.
- It will integrate with the existing beertracker.nl website to synchronize consumption data in real-time.

**Relevant**:

- The system directly addresses the students' need for a fair, automated way to track beer consumption.
- It reduces the complexity of keeping track of who owes what, ensuring a hassle-free experience for social drinking events.

**Time-bound**:

- The system will be fully implemented and tested by the end of the 10 weeks.

### Users
The primary users of this system are HvA students. They need a system that can accurately track the order of beer in a fair and automated way, ensuring that payments are distributed equally among all users. 
#### Scope
- The system will only be used by HvA students in their (current) third year.
- The scope includes beer (pitcher) order tracking, clocking in and out of sessions, and easy access to consumption data.

### User Needs

#### SMART Goals
- **Specific**: The system must allow students to clock in when they start drinking and clock out when they stop, accurately logging consumption times and calculating how much each person owes.
- **Measurable**: The system should record the number of users and total beer consumption during each session.
- **Achievable**: The solution will be implemented using an RFID scanning of HvA ID's to make clocking in and out simple and quick.
- **Relevant**: This system directly addresses the problem of unequal beer consumption and payment confusion among students.
- **Time-bound**: The system should be operational by the end of the 10 weeks assigned to this project.
