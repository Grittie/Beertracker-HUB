## Concept

The **Smart Check in / out system** is being developed for [beertracker.nl](http://beertracker.nl) <img src="../../assets/images/logo.png" alt="Alt text" width="100" />, a platform used by third-year HvA TI students. The system helps track beer ordering so that everyone pays equally without needing to request payments after the fact.

### Users
The primary users of this system are third-year HvA Technical Informatics (TI) students. They need a system that can accurately track the order of beer in a fair and automated way, ensuring that payments are distributed equally among all users. 
#### Scope
- The system will only be used by HvA TI students in their (current) third year.
- The scope includes beer (pitcher) order tracking, clocking in and out of sessions, and easy access to consumption data.


### User Needs

#### SMART Goals
- **Specific**: The system must allow students to clock in when they start drinking and clock out when they stop, accurately logging consumption times and calculating how much each person owes.
- **Measurable**: The system should record the number of users and total beer consumption during each session.
- **Achievable**: The solution will be implemented using an RFID scanning of HvA ID's to make clocking in and out simple and quick.
- **Relevant**: This system directly addresses the problem of unequal beer consumption and payment confusion among students.
- **Time-bound**: The system should be operational by the end of the 10 weeks assigned to this project.
