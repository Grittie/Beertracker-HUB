# Requirements

This document outlines the hardware *and* functional requirements for the **Smart Time Registration Device**. The system is based on an ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1-N8R8 and is designed to handle RFID-based user identification, API communication, provide user interaction through buttons to cycle between actions, LEDs, and a buzzer.

- **Buzzer**: For feedback on card scan
- **LEDs**: Multiple for system status indication
- **Buttons**: For switching between actions (e.g., Clock In, Clock Out, Start Break, End Break)
- **Connectivity**: Wi-Fi for making API calls to the website

## Functional Requirements

### 1. **RFID Scanning**
   - The system will use the RFID-RC522 RFID sensor to scan user HVA IDs.
   - Upon scanning, the system will push the ID data via an API call.

### 2. **API Communication**
   - The ESP32-S3 will connect to the internet to make API calls:
     - **Send scanned data** (RFID) to the server.
     - **Receive user data** (e.g., user name) in response and display on the LCD.

### 3. **Display and Feedback**
   - The LCD screen, connected via I2C, will show user information and action statuses.
   - The buzzer will sound when a card is successfully scanned.
   - LEDs will provide status indications for:
     - Power (system turned on)
     - Internet connectivity (connected/disconnected)
     - Card scan status (success/failure)

### 4. **User Input and Actions**
   - The system will have buttons to switch between different actions:
     - Clock In
     - Clock Out
     - Start Break
     - End Break

| **ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1-N8R8**       | MCU       | Microcontroller to handle processing and communication.                       |
| **RC522**          | Input     | Reads RFID cards to identify users.                                           |
| **LCD Display**    | Output    | Displays the user name and system statuses.                                   |
| **Buzzer**         | Output    | Emits sound on successful card scan.                                          |
| **LEDs**           | Output    | Shows system status: Power, Internet Connectivity, and Card Scan result.      |
| **Buttons**        | Input     | Allows the user to switch between actions (Clock In, Clock Out, etc.).        |

## System Workflow

1. **Power On**: System starts, LEDs indicate power and system status.
2. **Internet Connection**: LED indicates when the system is connected to the internet.
3. **RFID Scan**: User scans their ID card using the RC522 sensor.
4. **API Call**: The ESP32-S3 sends the RFID data to the server via API.
5. **API Response**: System receives user information and displays it on the LCD screen.
6. **Action Selection**: User selects the action (Clock In/Out, Start/End Break) via buttons.
7. **Feedback**: Buzzer sounds when a card is scanned, LEDs change based on status (e.g., card scan success).
